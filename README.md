## Printing

[Download as pdf](full.pdf)

I recommend printing this with two pages per side of a real page (so 4 pages per piece of paper).  
Advantages:
- Comfortable font size for reading
- Landscape format better suited for tiny desks in lecture halls
- Often, you can look at all content of one topic at once: (Haskell, Prolog/Unification, Lambda/Types, Bytecode)
- Saves paper ðŸŒ³

## Building

Prerequisites: bash, pandoc, maybe LaTeX idk  
Be sure that the line endings in combine.sh are LF only!  

Build using:
```
sh ./combine.sh
```
